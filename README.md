## How to run the project

Since this is a **NodeJS** based project the first thing you'll need is to have NodeJS already installed in your computer, you can find it [here](https://nodejs.org/). üò∏

If **NodeJS** was successfully installed you should be able to run the following command in your command line tool (you may need to reopen it if that's the case):

```
node --version
```

If the version of **NodeJS** you just installed was shown in the terminal you are good to go, if not then there might have been an issue during the installation.

By now you should clone this repo into your computer either by downloading it from this page or by using **git** from your command line tool as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/NoisyApple/lost-and-found-fe
```

Once having both NodeJS installed and the repo cloned into your computer you can run the following command in the root of the repo (same path as this `README.md` file):

```
npm install
```
This previous command should have generated a `node_modules` folder, after that you can run the project by running the next command:

```
npm run server
```

A tab should have been opened in your web browser with the project running there.

üìù **NOTE:** The development server in which this project runs when you run `npm run server` uses the port **4040** if you are already using it there might be a problem then.
